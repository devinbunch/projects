## Background

You are going to replicate the core result from [McDermott et al. (PNAS, 2018)](https://grantmcdermott.com/papers/mcdermott2019blueparadox.pdf), "The blue paradox: Preemptive overfishing in marine reserves". As the title suggests, the paper is essentially about a way in which anticipatory behaviour can undermine conservation goals. In particular, we document a preemptive surge in fishing effort within the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (i.e. PIPA) --- a pristine area of Pacific Ocean roughly the size of California --- once people realised that it was going to be closed off to commercial fishing in 2015. The paper implements a difference-in-differences strategy using data from Global Fishing Watch (GFW). Here's the key figure that I want you to reproduce.

## Preliminaries: Load packages, read in shapefiles and other data

**Note:** Since the assignment is aimed at practicing your BigQuery skills, I've gone ahead and written the first few code chunks for you. These are mostly auxiliary steps that will help you set up your environment and query the right data. 

Start by loading the packages needed to complete this assignment. Note that I'm going to use the **rms** package, but I don't want to load it yet because it will create a bunch of namespace conflicts with **dplyr**.

```{r packages, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, lubridate, DBI, dbplyr, bigrquery, sandwich, here)
pacman::p_install(rms, force=FALSE)
```

Next, read in a shapefile of the [Kiribati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiribati) exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This EEZ comprises a cluster of three island groups in the equatorial Pacific: 1) the Line Islands, 2) the Gilbert Islands, and 3) the Phoenix Islands. We are going to use the first two of these to create a control group. The treatment group will come from (part of) the third group.

```{r kiribati_eez}
dsn_dir = here("data/shapefiles/kiribati_eez/")
## Read in Kiribati shapefile
kiribati_eez = 
  read_sf(dsn = dsn_dir, layer = "kiribati_eez") %>%
  select(GeoName, geometry)
## Get the projection string for later
proj_str = st_crs(kiribati_eez)

## Subset Line Islands
line = 
  kiribati_eez %>%
  subset(GeoName %in% c("Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Line Islands)")) %>%
  rename(region = GeoName) %>%
  mutate(region = "Line Group")

## Subset Gilbert Islands
gilbert = 
  kiribati_eez %>%
  subset(GeoName %in% c("Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Gilbert Islands)")) %>%
  rename(region = GeoName) %>%
  mutate(region = "Gilbert Islands")

## Daily, vessel-level fishing effort effort in Kirbati, split by sub-area
gfw = read_csv(here("data/gfw_split.csv"))
#get rid of the date format
gfw[["date"]] = as.character(gfw$Date)
```

Then, read in a shapefile of PIPA. 

```{r pipa}
dsn_dir = here("data/shapefiles/pipa_shapefile/")

## Read in PIPA shapefile
pipa = 
  read_sf(dsn = dsn_dir, layer = "worldheritagemarineprogramme") %>%
  st_transform(proj_str) %>%
  select(region = full_name, geometry) %>%
  mutate(region = "PIPA")
```

Bind our control and treatment areas into a single object.

```{r all_regions}
## Merge all regions of interest
all_regions = rbind(line, gilbert, pipa)
```

Finally, we'll get the bounding box of the study area to help limit our query to the GFW database. I'm also going to set the resolution for the "bins" that I want you to aggregate the data up to and pull in a data frame of treatment and control areas sizes (in km^2^) that I've already created.

```{r bbox}
## Get bounding box of Kiribati
bbox = 
  kiribati_eez %>%
  st_bbox()

## Extent the bounding box 1 degree in every direction.
## We will use these limits to query the GFW database
min_lon = bbox[["xmin"]] - 1 
max_lon = bbox[["xmax"]] + 1
min_lat = bbox[["ymin"]] - 1
max_lat = bbox[["ymax"]] + 1 

## A "cheat" for bounding boxes that extend over the antemeridian (i.e. 180/-180 degree line)
if(min_lon <= -180) {
  min_lon =
    kiribati_eez %>% 
    st_crop(c(xmin=180, xmax=0, ymin=min_lat, ymax=max_lat)) %>%
    st_bbox() %>%
    pluck("xmin") - 1
}
if(max_lon >= 180) {
  max_lon =
    kiribati_eez %>% 
    st_crop(c(xmin=0, xmax=-180, ymin=min_lat, ymax=max_lat)) %>%
    st_bbox() %>%
    pluck("xmax") + 1
}


## Define mapping resoluion in degrees
resolution = 0.5
```
## 1) Set up your BigQuery connection

Establish a BigQuery connection like we practiced in class (call it `con`). Use your regular billing ID, but make sure that you set the project to "global-fishing-watch" and the dataset to "global_footprint_of_fisheries".

```{r con, cache=FALSE}

# Disclaimer: Devin has done ALL the work on this assignment . . . 

## Read in regional area sizes
region_areas = read_csv(here("data/region_areas.csv"))
region_areas

## Point towards your previously-generated GCP service key to avoid potential 
## authentication errors during the Rmd knit process. See:
## https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html#sidebar-2-i-just-want-my--rmd-to-render

#library(bigquery)  ## already loaded

#from our local r environment, we already have our authentication saved to use for our connection
bq_auth(path = Sys.getenv("GCE_AUTH_FILE"))
billing_id = Sys.getenv("GCE_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID")

#creating a connection to the database through DuckDB
con =
  dbConnect(
    bigrquery::bigquery(),
    project = "global-fishing-watch",
    dataset = "global_footprint_of_fisheries",
    billing = billing_id
    )
```
**Google BigQuery is part of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that we signed up for in the cloud computing lecture. There also exists public datasets available for free use on  Google BigQuery, one being the dataset required for this assignment!**

## 2) Test the connection and authenticate if prompted

Confirm that you have a successful connection by running `DBI::dbListTables(con)`. This should generate a list of available tables in this dataset. You may also be prompted to authenticate if you are running this for the first time. (Make sure to run this section interactively before knitting your document.)

```{r}
#success! 
DBI::dbListTables(con)
```
**note: looks like we've got 4 available tables in our dataset**

## 3) Create and preview the table of interest

We are particularly interested in the **"fishing_effort"** table. Reference this table to a new object in your R environment called `effort` using the the `dplyr::tbl()` function. Preview the new `effort` table after you have created it.

```{r}
#from dplyr, create our reference object "effort" 
# to call upon the fishing effort table from our database
effort = tbl(con, "fishing_effort")
#print it out!
effort

#now to get the full data
mpas = tbl(con, "fishing_effort","fishing_effort_byvessel", "fishing_vessels","vessels")
mpas
```

## 4) Query the database

*Note: If you are feeling ambitious, you can try to run the query on the whole polygon(s) instead. See the BONUS question at the end.*

Now, we get to the meat of the assignment. I want you to query the effort table and isolate the observations of interest. This will involve three steps --- which I'll detail individually below for clarity --- but please still run all three steps as part of the *same* query. In other words, you need to bundle all three steps together in a single query. Running them individually will result in errors.

**Step 1: Filter the observations that meet the following criteria.**

- Maximum date of 31 December, 2016 (to coincide with the published figure).
- `lat_bin` and `lon_bin` fall within the bounding box of interest. Some important comments and tips:
  - Use the `min_lat`, `max_lat`, `min_lon`, and `max_lon` variables that we created earlier as references for the bounding box. However, note that I have redefined the longitude variables to account for the [antimeridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180th_meridian). The upshot is that I recommend you filter longitude according to an "OR" rule, i.e. `lon_bin >= min_lon | lon_bin <= max_lon`. For latitude, you should feel free to filter according to a regular "AND" rule (e.g. use sequential filters or just commas).
  - Also note that longitude and latitude columns of the database have been multiplied by 100. If I were you, the very first step of my query would be reversing this transformation with a mutate call (hint hint).
- `fishing_hours` greater than zero.

**Step 2: Create binned data.** Once you have written out your filter commands, you need to aggregate the data. However, before that you need to create binned data cells (i.e. squares) of a desired resolution. (I've already set a `resolution` variable equal to `r resolution` in the preliminary part of this assignment.) For clues on how you could do this, take a look [here](http://jsmayorga.com/post/getting-global-fishing-watch-from-google-bigquery-using-r/#make-a-map-of-fishing-effort-for-a-particular-region-of-the-ocean). In particular, look where Juan (the author) creates the `lat_bin_center` and `lon_bin_center` variables.

**Step 3: Summarise your data.** Aggregate your data up to the day (i.e. `date`) by bin (i.e. `lat_bin_center`, `lon_bin_center`) level.

You can do all of this using either **dplyr** or SQL, though I recommend you stick with the former. Do *not* collect the data yet, but call the resulting query object `effort_query`.

**One of the best things about dplyr is that it automatically translates tidyverse-style code into SQL for you by using the function `show_query()`**

```{r}
#run query
#success!

## Define the desired bin resolution in degrees
resolution <- 0.5 ##given by grant in instructions

effort_query_binned =
  mpas %>%
  filter(
    `_PARTITIONTIME` >= "2016-01-01 00:00:00",
    `_PARTITIONTIME` <= "2016-12-31 00:00:00"
    ) %>%
  filter(fishing_hours > 0) %>%
  mutate(
    lat_bin = lat_bin/100,
    lon_bin = lon_bin/100
    ) %>%
  mutate(
    lat_bin_center = floor(lat_bin/resolution)*resolution + 0.5*resolution,
    lon_bin_center = floor(lon_bin/resolution)*resolution + 0.5*resolution
    ) %>%
  group_by(date, lat_bin_center, lon_bin_center)  %>%
  summarise(fishing_hours = sum(fishing_hours, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  collect()
```

**for sql language: we filtered the coordinates so that they are inside our bounding box. To do this we add ? before the name of our locally defined variable and its value gets automatically added to the query**

## 5) Collect the data

Now collect the data (i.e. pull it into you R environment). Assign the resulting data frame to an object called `effort_ binned`.

```{r}
#we already did this above, but just for future reference,
effort_binned <- effort_query_binned %>% collect()

#print it out
effort_binned

#our new variables are only: lat_bin_center, lon_bin_center, date, and fishing_hours
```

## 6) Disconnect

Following good practice, make sure that you disconnect from `con`.

```{r discon, cache=FALSE}
## Put your disconnect code here
dbDisconnect(con)
```

## 7) Convert to **sf** object

Convert `effort_binned` data frame into an **sf** object. Now is also a good time to convert the "date" string to an actual date. (Note that you may need to ungroup the object first.)

*Hint: Pay attention to the "coords" option of the `st_as_sf()` function.*

```{r}
#class(effort_binned)
#nice, we have a data frame
#let's ungroup it
effort_binned %>% ungroup() 

#check coordinates of bbox and plug into an sf object 
sfc  =  st_sfc(st_point(c(-180,180)), st_point(c(-13.838333,7.879056)))
class(sfc)
class(sf_object)
# I need to make a geometry sf data frame
effort_binned <- st_as_sf(effort_binned, sfc)
all_regions <- st_as_sf(all_regions, sfc)
class(effort_binned)

# set the geometry
effort_binned = sf_df %>% st_geometry(sf_object$geometry)

#then after I make my sf object, 
st_crs(effort_binned) <- proj_str
attr(effort_binned, "sf_column") = "geometry"
```

## 8) Finalise the data

Now come the final stages of preparing the data. I'll walk you through this in three steps.

### 8.1) Crop to the region of interest

Crop `effort_binned` to the region of interest (i.e. using the `all_regions` **sf** object that we created earlier). Call the resulting object **`gfw`**. 

You won't need any more spatial analysis after this, so feel free to coerce this newly created object into a regular tibble afterwards. You will also want to filter out any observations where the "region" column is `NA`. 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE}
#use this command to make sure things are running ! they are! nice! we have a geometry column
st_geometry(all_regions)

b = st_as_sf(effort_binned)
a = st_as_sf(all_regions)
attr(effort_binned, "sf_column")

#join regions 
#gfw <- st_join(effort_binned, all_regions) ## use st_join on type sfc :)
d = st_join(a,b)
d
#print it out to see what's going on
gfw = d ## I guess I did that correctly, nice ! let's rename it what it should be

# now covert it to tibble format
gfw = as_tibble(gfw)

#get rid of NAs
gfw = gfw %>% filter(!is.na(region))

#look at it 
gfw
#yay! nice job
```


### 8.2) Get daily totals and complete missing dates

Take your `gfw` data frame and aggregate the "fishing_hours" variable up the day (i.e. date) by region level. You will also want to complete any missing dates. Please make sure that the "fishing_hours" column from these filled-in missing dates are not left as `NA`; rather I want you to replace them with zero.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Collapse into a new data frame of daily means, summed by region
gfw_daily <- 
  gfw %>%
  group_by(Date, region, yr, mnth, wk, dofw) %>%
  select(contains("hours")) %>% ## Will automatically select group variables above too
  summarise_at(vars(raw_hours:nnet_hours_norm), sum, na.rm = T) %>%
  ungroup
```

### 8.3) Split into control and treatment and normalize fishing hours by area

Okay, I'll write out this last step for you. Make sure that you delete `eval=FALSE` in the chunk header once you are ready to knit the whole document, or else this chunk won't produce any output.

```{r gfw_3, eval = FALSE}
gfw =
  gfw %>%
  left_join(region_areas) %>%
  mutate(region = ifelse(region=="PIPA", "PIPA", "Control")) %>%
  group_by(date, region) %>%
  mutate(area_km2 = sum(area_km2)) %>%
  mutate(fishing_hours_norm = fishing_hours/area_km2*1000) %>%
  summarise(fishing_hours_norm = sum(fishing_hours_norm)) %>% 
  ungroup 
gfw
```


## Epilogue: Plot the figure

Assuming that you made it this far, you should be able to run the below chunk ---again, making sure that you delete `eval=FALSE` in the chunk header first --- and it will generate a figure that closely resembles Figure 3 of the paper. There are a couple reasons why it isn't an exact copy. Most importantly, in the paper we use a measure of fishing effort that is produced by a different classification algorithm. (For reasons that we explain in the paper and I can go into if you're interested.) However, there's also a fairly mechanical reason associated with how we queried and aggregated the data in this assignment. Can you think of it?

*Hint: Think about how the bins are defined here...*

## BONUS: Query by polygon geometry

In Question 4, you were asked to query the data by lat-lon bins. This was fairly inefficient and finicky. We had to adjust for the antimeridan when setting our bound box and ultimately had to crop and aggregate the data by region again anyway (in Question 8). 

As a matter of fact, BigQuery supports [geometric functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions) using the same basic simple features verbs that we learned about back in the spatial lecture. (Albeit, the SQL equivalents this time.)

For bonus marks, see if you can query the data by *(multi)polygon*. In other words, write a query that downloads daily effort data --- one data point per day --- for the whole of PIPA. Do the same for the entire control region. Doing this directly in the SQL call (i.e. on the BigQuery side) will allow you to skip several intermediate steps in the assignment above.

*Hints: You will have to write these queries using direct SQL rather than relying on the dplyr translation (see the link above for clues). I would recommend using the `glue::glue_sql()` approach that I showed you in the databases lecture. You can get the text representation of a feature's geometry with `st_as_text(st_geometry(FEATURE))`.*
